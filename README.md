ttrss-flattr
============

Plugin for the RSS reader Tiny Tiny RSS to flattr articles.

Copy this directory into the plugins folder of your tt-rss instance. Then, you can activate it in the settings panel of tt-rss. Some people report that the folder should be named 'flattr' in order to show up in the settings panel.

Currently, the plugin checks the Flattr catalogue and only displays the button if the article exists as a thing there (see more comments in the code). Two things to note about that:

* The plugin does this check for each article being displayed, so it can weigh a bit on the loading time of your article view (but for me, it works quite okay and I am on shared hosting).
* Flattr has just integrated with popular services (e.g. Twitter and Github), such that everyone there can be flattred [1], so this plugin should probably be adapted to match those new circumstances. Not sure how yet, though.
